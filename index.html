      What if you could start earning money with zero investment — just using free AI tools?
      Today I'll show you 5 AI apps that help you launch a side hustle, automate tasks, and get paid — starting right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>First up — ChatGPT + Fiverr.</strong> Sell writing, code, or marketing gigs using ChatGPT.
      You take a client's prompt → ChatGPT does the work → You get paid.
      Thousands of people are doing this as "AI prompt engineers." Potential earnings: $25 to $100 per job.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Next — Leonardo.ai.</strong> It's a free AI design tool. Create stunning images, product mockups, logos, or even coloring books.
      Upload your art to Etsy, Redbubble, or Gumroad. You can earn $10–$200 a day just from selling assets you generate with prompts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tool 3 — OpusClip.</strong> It takes long-form videos (like podcasts or YouTube clips) and turns them into short-form content in seconds.
      You can offer this as a service to creators on Instagram or YouTube. Charge $50 per bundle of 10 shorts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tool 4 — Replit with Ghostwriter.</strong> Even if you're not a coder, you can build mini apps or AI tools — like resume generators or business name creators.
      Use their AI coding assistant, and deploy in one click. You can charge $5–$50/month for micro-SaaS products.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tool 5 — Notion + Gumroad.</strong> Turn your knowledge or prompt collections into digital products.
      Bundle up your best ChatGPT prompts, AI startup guides, or side hustle trackers and list them on Gumroad.
      These can sell for $10–$200+ on autopilot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start with just one tool. Don't overthink it — take action today.
